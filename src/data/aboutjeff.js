export const aboutJeff = `I graduated from the Guitar Repair and Construction program at Minnesota Southeast technical, Red Wing in 2006.

Following graduation, I was happy to accept a job in Seattle at the Dusty Strings harp and dulcimer factory.  I worked on the finish team where I learned the finer points of sanding, sanding  and more sanding.  Also, spraying and touch ups.  It was a great training ground for developing a fine eye and learn about efficiency.

However the pull of repairs wouldnâ€™t leave me, so I ended up working for Mike Lull in Bellevue.  In this fast paced shop, I was able to learn a great deal about many instruments but mostly electric basses and guitars.  It was a great opportunity to learn real world experience from experts.  A side bonus was I got to work on many beautiful high end instruments.

I truly wanted to round out my knowledge and expand my skill set, so I set out for the Dusty Strings repair department.  Again, I was lucky enough to work with some true masters and learn, learn, learn.  This environment proved to be mostly acoustic instruments, but that was what I needed.   Neck resets, bridge reglues, fretwork, huge rebuild projects.  Eventually I was able to work my way up to Repair Shop Manager.

In 2016 after having learned so much all these years, I was ready to strike out on my own.  Hang my shingle.  I grew up in Tacoma, so it seems it has come full circle.  

I am ready to help with your project, large or small.  Acoustic or electric.`
